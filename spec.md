## Jest Testing

- simple component testing for each component (as here: https://medium.com/capital-one-developers/unit-testing-behavior-of-react-components-with-test-driven-development-ae15b03a3689) this is simple and mainly copy and paste) [ ]

## Other

- note: you can see the shape of the poster object which is posted to the API in the redux reducers code.
- test that data POSTed to the API reflects the changes in the UI. For example, if the theme is changed to blue, the object posted to the API should change correctly [ ]
- you should test the above for all the various inputs [ ]
- test the API code in the Redux sagas (you can use Jest to test here too â€“ https://medium.com/@gethylgeorge/using-redux-saga-to-handle-side-effects-and-testing-it-using-jest-2dff2d59f899) [ ]
